      <h2>Dedication</h2>
      <p>To the quietly unhinged, the beautifully broken, and the ones who laugh at the darkest parts of their stories.
      May you always dance with your demons, and make them wear heels.</p>
      <p>To the girls who never got the apology.<br>
      To the women who turned their pain into power.<br>
      To the ones who said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù and meant it like a compliment.<br>
      This is for you.</p>
      <p>To my wife, Keri‚Äîthank you for patiently waiting for me to finish writing this book. I know it started off as a way to escape and vent, but you let me creatively flow, spiral, and stitch this world back together without judgment. I love you more than words can carry.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>To my late-night thoughts and my early-morning doubts‚Äîyou both kept me grounded.<br>
      To my friends who answered ‚ÄúIs this too much?‚Äù with ‚ÄúNot enough‚Äù‚Äîthank you.<br>
      To every reader who rooted for Pooh, even when she crossed the line and danced on the other side of morality‚Äîyou saw her the way I did.</p>
      <p>To my editors, my coffee, and my sanity‚Äînone of which survived this process in one piece.</p>
      <p>And to the versions of myself that I had to outgrow just to write this: thank you for the fire. The scars make better ink.</p>
